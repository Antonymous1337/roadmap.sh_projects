        <p>I am an honors graduate from the University of Washington Bothell campus (CGPA 3.92). I am currently seeking new opportunities as a software engineer and desire to make a strong contribution to my team.<br><br>

        I love to engage with new and unique algorithms for challenging and complex problems and to help other people learn these concepts as well. As someone who frequently guided my peers to success, I found immense satisfaction in helping them to learn what they needed in class to pass the courses we shared, and even to excel at them!<br><br>

        I am the most well-versed in Java, but other languages I have experience in are C++, SQL, PHP, Java, JS, CSS, and HTML (let's pretend HTML is a language for the sake of the sentence).</p>
