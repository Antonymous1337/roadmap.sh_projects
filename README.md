# Welcome to my roadmap.sh projects!

The projects are ordered based on the ordering in <a href=https://roadmap.sh/projects target="_blank">roadmap.sh</a>, which is from easiest to hardest. Feel free to look around!

If you find my work interesting, please contact me at <a href="mailto:holshouserantony@yahoo.com" target="_blank">holshouserantony@yahoo.com</a>, and I would be more than glad to help however I can.

The above email link may not work if you don't have a default email handler for your device set up.

To access the home page for all of these projects, <a href="https://antonymous1337.github.io/roadmap.sh_projects/">you can find it here</a>.
