# Welcome to my roadmap.sh projects!

The projects are ordered based on the ordering in <a href=https://roadmap.sh/projects target="_blank">roadmap.sh</a>, which is from easiest to hardest. Feel free to look around!

While AI is changing the coding landscape and I fully support the cautious use of AI, I have refrained from using AI in these projects to help me learn foundational concepts better.

If you find my work interesting, please contact me at <a href="mailto:holshouserantony@yahoo.com" target="_blank">holshouserantony@yahoo.com</a>, and I would be more than glad to help however I can.
