                <p>Antony is an exceptional student, professional, and friend! I had the pleasure of working with Antony in a user design course that focused on Human Centered Design. Their commitment to learning, spreading knowledge, and helping others truly makes them one of a kind. I am always impressed by his work ethic and communication skills. Antony has extensive technical skills in coding, user experience design, and psychological research. In the classroom, Antony can always be found encouraging others, and being active in discussions, and group work. Oftentimes, he would ask questions that were much beyond the scope of the class, showing his passion for diving deep into concepts, learning more, and challenging himself. Whenever we teamed up for in-class group activities or quizzes, his positive vibe turned our collaboration into a productive and enjoyable experience. What stood out was his talent for keeping things professional while also creating a supportive and humorous environment. Working with Antony was an absolute joy, and his positive energy made our interactions so much fun. No matter how confused our group was, Antony never failed to make us laugh and keep us motivated :) He would be an asset to any team!</p>

                <p>Antony is a great classmate to collaborate with. He takes the time ensuring there is a great amount of detail and pride when it comes to his work. What I love about working with him is how he's able to communicate and work with ideas and others when it comes to group work.<br><br>

                I've seen many classmates help each other out when it comes to assignments, Antony goes above and beyond assisting anyone that may not understand that assignment. He has great leadership skills, which does translate into his coding and teamwork skills.<br><br>

                Overall, I would like to work with Antony more in the future.</p>
