# Accessible Form UI

Accessible Form UI based on the project description in <a href="https://roadmap.sh/projects/accessible-form-ui" target="_blank">roadmap.sh</a>.

The requirements are as follows:
- UI Form with full name, email, password, and confirm password (and password visibility toggles)
- Progress Bar UI
- Static UI based on visual mockup
- Proper use of CSS Techniques (Flexbox, Grid, and box model)
- Labeling
- Focus State Styling
- Error Messaging
- ARIA Attributes
- WCAG 2.2 AAA Compliance
- Interactive Elements
- Explore Axe and NVDA (not Nvidia) for accessibility debugging

I had an issue with trying to make NVDA say extra descriptive information for completed tasks and for the completion circle.

If you know how to solve that, please contact me at <a href="mailto:holshouserantony@yahoo.com">holshouserantony@yahoo.com</a>
